# Association of the donor immunological status with the outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using posttransplantation cyclophosphamide

## Background

Despite the active development of targeted and immunotherapy, allo-HSCT remains one of the important options for patients with hematological malignancies. However, this procedure is associated with a multitude of risks, and one of the main life-threatening complications is GVHD.

Numerous prophylactic regimens for GVHD have been developed, and in recent years, prophylaxis with cyclophosphamide has gained popularity due to its demonstrated high clinical efficacy. However, the biological effects of cyclophosphamide and its impact on recipient immune reconstitution remain not fully understood, and this issue is currently actively researched. A research team has already conducted a study involving patients receiving Cy, which demonstrated an association between the cellular composition of the transplant on one hand, and immune reconstitution (and consequently, survival) and the likelihood of developing severe GVHD on the other. Consequently, the idea of a possible association with the peripheral blood composition of the donor has emerged, which would allow predicting transplantation outcomes based on analysis of the donor's peripheral blood even before the donation procedure.

This suggests the potential for pre-transplant screening based on donor peripheral blood analysis, enhancing the ability to predict transplantation outcomes and tailor interventions accordingly.

### Purpose
The purpose of this study is to identify potential predictors of allo-HSCT (allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) outcomes based on the immunological characteristics of the donorâ€™s peripheral blood.

### Objectives
1.Preprocessing complex data
2.Descriptive statistics to describe donor & patient characteristics, HSCT procedure and its outcomes
3.Identification of outcomes and their potential predictors
4.Exploratory analysis:
   -Identification of correlated variables (correlation analysis, clustering, principal component analysis)
   -Identification of associations (univariate regression analysis)
5.Assessment of the potential association between donor immunological characteristics and allogeneic HSCT outcomes
6.Development of a model including immunological and other characteristics to predict allogeneic HSCT outcomes
7.Model quality assessment (added predictive value)
