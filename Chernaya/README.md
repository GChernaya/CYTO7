In the analysis, I not only applied methods to the data but also practiced with several related 
functions and packages. I'm providing the table of contents for the applied methods below. 
Please note that some of them were included out of curiosity rather than necessity. 
All relevant methods can be found in describtion in the main README file.
Analysis.Rmd is the file with data preparation and summary statistics.
PCA.Rmd is the part of exploratory data analysis, there are functions for clustering, PCA and FAMD with kNN imputation
Model.Rmd is the final cox regression pipeline which include usage of LASSO for selection of variables and bootstrap.
